**This project is under construction.**

The first prompt asks if you would like to change the radius of the sphere. 
		Press 1 to change the radius. If you were to use this program for the Moon, Mars, or any other celestial body, invoke this option.
		Press Enter to leave the default at 6,371 kilometers for the radius of the Earth.

Point A. Enter the latitude of one of the points.
Next enter the longitude of that point.

Point B. Now enter the latitude of the other point.
Enter the longitude for this point.

The distance will now appear in both kilometers and miles.
Also the bearing will appear with 0Â° as north increasing clockwise.
